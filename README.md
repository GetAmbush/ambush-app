# Invoicer

Fork of the Ambush app focused only on Android app.
This fork will release an Android version on each new version of the original app.

The distribution will be done through the Git releases. I suggest using [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) to automate the download/install process.
